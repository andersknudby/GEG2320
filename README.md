Data for GEG2320, University of Ottawa

This repository was created as part of a project to develop open-access lab notes for the University of Ottawa's "GIS and the Digital Earth" course and its French counterpart "SIG et la Terre num√©rique". It contains lab notes for five labs with exercises for this introductory course, as well as the data needed for students to work through the labs. All labs are based on ArcGIS Pro, and requires students to have access to this software. The content of this repository is provided for the public under a CC BY 4.0 license.
